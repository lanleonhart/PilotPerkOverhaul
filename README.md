# PilotPerkOverhaul Mod

--Description--

This mod is designed to add flavor to Battletech backer and ronin pilots. This mod incorporates a graphical tweak represent the pilots origin. The pilot rank pips have been overhauled to have a similar vibe to MechCommander 2. This mod adds over 30 new pilot perks which have been categorized into Positive, Mixed, and Negative Perks. In addition this mod gived every pilot 4 base characteristic traits. Eye Color, Blood Type, Stature, and Handedness, thes traits are just fluff to give characters so more minor depth.

This comes with a python script to randomly generate perks for all the vanilla backer and ronin pilots, & write these changes to each indiviudal pilots JSON file. In the scripts current configuration its set up to roll perks added based on the parameters set in the script. You can add / remove your own traits and adjust the parameters as needed.


The mod should work natively with BTA3062, and is intended to be used for the GN Wars Mod Pack.
