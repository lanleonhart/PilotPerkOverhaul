# PilotPerkOverhaul Mod
 Contains only the graphical UI changes from the Pilot Perk Overhaul Mod


This mod is an overhaul of the Ronin and Backer Pilots in Battletech. Each Pilot will have traits that provide a benefit to the in or outside the battlefield. Along with these changes there is an added graphical update component. You will now see new PIPs when looking at the pilot in the barracks. You will see a faction symbol denoting their origins, New rank symbols have been introduced loosely based off ranks from MechCommander 2.
